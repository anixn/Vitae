	abstract = {Rainfall-runoff models are often used to simulate the impact of long-term climate change on future water availability. A common assumption in most modeling frameworks is that catchment's hydrologically relevant characteristics, represented via model parameters, remain constant. However, several studies present evidence on the contrary and suggest potential biases in estimates of future streamflow due to this assumption. Regardless, there is a lack of modeling frameworks that account for the possible impact of climate on catchment's characteristics. To change model parameters with climate, we propose a method based on the Whittaker biome plot that relates biome type to the climatic setting of a catchment. We compare estimates of catchment's vulnerability to climate change obtained from fixed and changing parameters. Our analysis spanning 83 catchments across the conterminous United States shows that considering changes in catchment's representative parameters with climate significantly alters the estimated vulnerability to climate change for a majority of catchments.},

	abstract = {Understanding how a watershed‚Äôs physio-climatic characteristics affect its vulnerability to environmental (climatic and land use) change is crucial for managing these complex systems. In this study, we combine the strengths of recently developed exploratory modeling frameworks and comparative hydrology to quantify the relationship between watershed‚Äôs vulnerability and its physio-climatic characteristics. We propose a deÔ¨Ånition of vulnerability that can be used by a diverse range of water system managers and is useful in the presence of large uncertainties in drivers of environmental change. This deÔ¨Ånition is related to adverse climate change and land use thresholds that are quantiÔ¨Åed using a recently developed exploratory modeling approach. In this way, we estimate the vulnerability of 69 watersheds in the United States to climate and land use change. We explore deÔ¨Ånitions of vulnerability that describe average or extreme Ô¨Çow conditions, as well as others that are relevant from the point of view of instream organisms. In order to understand the dominant controls on vulnerability, we correlate these indices with watershed‚Äôs characteristics describing its topography, geology, drainage, climate, and land use. We Ô¨Ånd that mean annual Ô¨Çow is more vulnerable to reductions in precipitation in watersheds with lower average soil permeability, lower baseÔ¨Çow index, lower forest cover, higher topographical wetness index, and vice-versa. Our results also indicate a potential mediation of climate change impacts by regional groundwater systems. By developing such relationships across a large range of watersheds, such information can potentially be used to assess the vulnerability of ungauged watersheds to uncertain environmental change.},

	abstract = {GCM downscaled climatic components are used to project extreme events such as drought and flood. GCM derived climatic derivatives induce uncertainties in projecting extreme events caused by climate change. The uncertainties occur due to uncertain emission scenarios, downscaling approach, and model parameterization uncertainty. Several approaches are proposed to overcome this shortcoming, but a recently developed bottom-up paradigm is helpful in the specific scenarios of extreme event projection and mitigation. In this work conventional, top-down approach (using the downscaled climate derivatives) is compared with a recently developed bottom-up framework in the projection of extreme events. The bottom-up approach works on the exploratory modeling framework where synthetic climate scenarios are generated using a delta change method. The proposed framework allows the extreme event‚Äôs predictions, utilizing the available climatic data (precipitation and temperature). Furthermore, the concept of comparative hydrology is used to develop generalized predictions on catchment-scale for the Indian sub-continent. In this study, we focused on the impact of climate change on drought. We used a change in precipitation and temperature on the dynamics of drought indices like PDSI and SPEI across the Indian sub-continent. We compiled a dataset for 215 catchments‚Äô physio-climatic characteristics, consisting of climatic, hydrologic, vegetation, and soil properties. The vulnerability of the catchment to drought with the change in climate using 30 years of data is assessed using data-mining algorithms. This study will help in understanding the vulnerability to the drought of catchments under varying climatic conditions and will help stakeholders in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change.},
